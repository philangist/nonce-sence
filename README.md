Http-Digest Auth with Bottle
============================

Simple Implementation of http-digest with Python/Bottle (because bottle doesn't actually support digest) based on the Wikepdia article [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication). This is obviously NOT production ready, but hopefully it can be a good starting point for anyone who needs this functionality.
